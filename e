 We can see that the probability of pulling a half-tablet increases by 50% each day if you have been pulling whole tablets until then. This means that the expected value for the number of days before pulling a half-tablet is the sum of an infinite geometric series with a common ratio of 0.5:

Expected value = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...

Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, the expected value can be calculated as follows:

Expected value = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = (1/2)/(1 - 1/2) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1.

Therefore, on average, it will take approximately 1 day before you pull a half-tablet out of the bottle.
